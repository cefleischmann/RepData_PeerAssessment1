1) Loading and preprocessing the data
===============
##### Unzip data to obtain a csv file

library("data.table")
library(ggplot2)

fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile = paste0(getwd(), '/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip'), method = "curl")
unzip("repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",exdir = "data")

#### Reading csv Data into Data.Table

activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")


2) What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
===========
##### Calculating the the total number of steps taken per day
Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm = FALSE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 

head(Total_Steps, 10)


##### Making a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day (I removed 8 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin))

ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) +
        geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) +
        labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")


#### Calculating and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE), Median_Steps = median(steps, na.rm = TRUE))]


3) What is the average daily activity pattern?
=================
#### Making a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval)] 

ggplot(IntervalDT, aes(x = interval , y = steps)) + geom_line(color="blue", size=1) + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps", x = "Interval", y = "Avg. Steps per day")

#### Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

IntervalDT[steps == max(steps), .(max_interval = interval)]


4) Imputing missing values
===========
##### Calculating the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

activityDT[is.na(steps), .N ]

##### Strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset: Filling in missing values with median of dataset.

activityDT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]

##### Creating a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

data.table::fwrite(x = activityDT, file = "data/tidyData.csv", quote = FALSE)

#### Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed:

#### 1. total number of steps taken per day
Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 

#### 2. mean and median total number of steps taken per day
Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps), Median_Steps = median(steps))]

ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) + geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) + labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")


5) Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
============
#### Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends

#### 1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
activityDT[, date := as.POSIXct(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")]
activityDT[, `Day of Week`:= weekdays(x = date)]
activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Montag|Dienstag|Mittwoch|Donnerstag|Freitag", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"]<- "weekday"
activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Samstag|Sonntag", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekend"
activityDT[, `weekday or weekend` := as.factor(`weekday or weekend`)]
head(activityDT, 20)


#### 2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis)

activityDT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval, `weekday or weekend`)] 

ggplot(IntervalDT , aes(x = interval , y = steps, color=`weekday or weekend`)) + geom_line() + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps by Weektype", x = "Interval", y = "No. of Steps") + facet_wrap(~`weekday or weekend` , ncol = 1, nrow=2)
